# Horiseon 

Horiseon was made to help your website easier to find online with different teams specializing in Marketing.

## Changes I made

Horiseon wanted their site's codebase to be accessible to everyone, and have the site be optimized for search engines. 

* Made sure all of the header links worked and took you to the right page
* Organized the CSS so there is no repeating code and there are comments made for each section
* Added alt tags to important images and made different HTML elements to make it easier for screen readers
* Made some comments to the HTML so every section is seperated making it easier for other coders
